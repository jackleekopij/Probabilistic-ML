    "# Probabilistic programming with TensorFlow (TF) Probability\n",
    "TF probability is a framework that machine learning practicioners, statisticians and data scienctists can use to incorporate domain knowledge to understand data and make predictions. \n",

    "Why use probabilistic methods? \n",
    "Uncertainty is ubiquitous; real-world phenomena — even those we completely understand — are subject to externalities beyond our control or even awareness.\n",
